Contributions:

Nombrado:

- Designed the UI such as (gnatt chart, table, buttons, panels, labels etc.
- Implemented the gnatt chart to work properly with the algorithms
- Implemented the algorithms FIFO, SJF, SRTF, RR, MLFQ (mainly team effort)

Diwa:

- Implemented the algorithms FIFO, SJF, SRTF, RR, MLFQ (mainly team effort)
- Implemented codes for UI to be interacted (buttons, tables, panels)
- Finalized the gnatt chart design (colors, sizes, text)
